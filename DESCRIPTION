Title: Wraps 'libnabo', a Fast K Nearest Neighbour Library for
    Low Dimensions
Version: 0.5.0
Author: Stephane Mangenat (for 'libnabo'), Gregory Jefferis
Maintainer: Gregory Jefferis <jefferis@gmail.com>
Description: An R wrapper for 'libnabo', an exact or approximate
    k nearest neighbour library which is optimised for low dimensional
    spaces (e.g. 3D).  'libnabo' has speed and space advantages over the
    'ANN' library wrapped by package 'RANN'. 'nabor' includes a knn
    function that is designed as a drop-in replacement for 'RANN' function
    nn2. In addition, objects which include the k-d tree search structure
    can be returned to speed up repeated queries of the same set of target
    points.
