Title: Wraps libnabo, a fast K Nearest Neighbour library for low dimensions
Version: 0.2

Description: an R wrapper for libnabo, an exact or approximate k nearest
    neighbour library which is optimised for low dimensional spaces (e.g. 3D).
    libnabo has speed and space advantages over the ANN library wrapped by
    package RANN. nabor includes a knn function that is designed as a drop-in
    replacement for RANN::nn2.
