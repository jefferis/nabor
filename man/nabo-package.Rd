\title{Wrapper for libnabo K Nearest Neighbours C++ library}
\description{
R package **nabo** wraps the [libnabo](https://github.com/ethz-asl/libnabo),
a fast K Nearest Neighbour library for low-dimensional spaces. The package
provides both standalone functions (see \code{\link{knn}} for basic queries
and also the option to produce an object containing the k-d tree search
(\code{\link{WKNN}}) structure for making multiple queries against the same
target points.
}
\details{
libnabo uses the same approach as the ANN library (wrapped in R package
\code{RANN}) but is generally faster and with a smaller memory footprint.
Furthermore since it is templated on the underlying scalar type for
coordinates (among other things), we have provided both float and double
coordinate implementations of the classes wrapping the search tree
structures. See the github repository and Elsenberg et al paper below for
details.
