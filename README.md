# nabor
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jefferis/nabor.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jefferis/nabor) 

R package **nabor** wraps [libnabo](https://github.com/ethz-asl/libnabo), 
a fast K Nearest Neighbour library for low-dimensional spaces implemented in templated C++.
In comparison with the widely used [ANN](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN) library (wrapped by the
[RANN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RANN/index.html) R package), **libnabo** is reported
to be 5% to 20% faster with more compact data structures.

## Quick start
```r
# install (see below for details)
install.packages("nabor")

# use
library(nabor)

# help
?nabor
?knn

# run examples
example(knn)
example(WKNN)

# run tests
library(testthat)
test_package("nabor")

# cite
citation("nabor")
```

## nabor vs RANN
For R users **nabor** provides a function, `knn`, that is a drop in replacement for
the `nn2` function in the [RANN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RANN/index.html) 
R package. I have seen speedups of 2-3x fold for queries of interest (a few thousand
points in 3d, k=1) when comparing nabor::knn and RANN::nn2. See `?knn` for details.

Furthermore **nabor** provides a mechanism for reusing the k-d search tree structure for 
multiple queries. This is achieved by wrapping a libnabo k-d tree and associated points
into a C++ class. This in turn is wrapped as an R reference class (by RcppModules)
that can be used in R. See `?WKNN` for details. The `WKNNF` class has the additional
feature of using floats (4 bytes per coordinate) for the underlying storage, rather
than the doubles used by R; this may be useful for large pointsets.
## Installation
### Released version from CRAN
The current stable version of the package is available from 
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). The package requires compilation, but
installing from CRAN allows mac and windows users without the full C++ compiler toolchain to install binary packages.

```r
install.packages("nabor")
```

### Development version from github
The **nabor** package is known to compile from source with the standard C(++) 
compiler toolchains for R under MacOS X, Windows and Linux. See 
http://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/ for details of the
developer toolchains needed for your platform.

Once you have installed the appropriate developer toolchain mentioned above, you
can use the **devtools** package to install the development version of the package:

```r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jefferis/nabor")
```

### Dependencies
The **nabor** package includes libnabo and all of its dependencies (boost, via 
package **BH**) and Eigen (via package **RcppEigen**) and does not
depend on any non-standard system libraries. It should therefore run out of the
box on any mac/linux/windows system.

## Acknowlegements
**libnabo** and therefore the **nabor** R package are released under the 
[BSD 3 clause license](http://www.r-project.org/Licenses/BSD_3_clause). If you
make use of **nabor** please cite the original authors:

**nabor** also makes use of the tremendous [Rcpp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html)
and [RcppEigen](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppEigen/index.html) packages –
kudos to their authors!
