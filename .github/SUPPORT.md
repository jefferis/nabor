# Getting help with nabor

Thanks for using nabor. We're sorry you're having trouble, but
we're here to help! To get help as quickly as possible, please read the following.

## Search
The first thing is to see if anyone has had your problem before:

* Search the [nat-user google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nat-user).
* Search GitHub for [_issues_ with the nabor package](https://github.com/natverse/nabor/issues).
* Search GitHub for [issues across the whole natverse](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Anatverse&type=Issues) in case 
  the problem is with a related package. You can add your own terms to the search 
  in the search box in the top left of that page.

If that solves your problem, then great! 

## Known Problems
If you need more help with a known problem:

* If you found a relevant thread on the [nat-user google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nat-user):
  please reply to that. 
* If you found a GitHub issue:
  please reply to that with more details (you'll need to a GitHub login) or just _like_ it to let us know you're having trouble too.
* If you're not sure:
  ask a new question on the [nat-user google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nat-user)
  linking to what you have found.


## New Problems
If it looks like a new problem then:

* If you just have a question:
  please ask the [nat-user google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nat-user).
* If you need to report a *new* bug:
  please [file an issue](https://github.com/natverse/nabor/issues/new).
* If you're not sure:
  please just ask the [nat-user google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nat-user)! If your 
  problem _is_ a bug or a feature request, you can easily return here and 
  report it - and we may be able to point you to an existing report or workaround.

## Good Questions and Bug Reports

* Be specific
* Include the code that triggered the problem
* If at all possible, make a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample (a *reprex*)

It will be much easier for us to help if we can run a *reprex* on 
our own machine without your data. You might want to use sample data 
from a nat package to help, or refer to publicly available data online.

You can use the [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package to help 
and read the [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/)
section of the tidyverse site for more information on this.

*Thanks for your help!*
